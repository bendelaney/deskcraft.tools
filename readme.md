this is a static website, built with pure HTML5, CSS, and JS. 

It does not use Tailwind, or any other frameworks. It has a nice clean reset stylesheet and obvious semantic html markup and clearly named classes. 

the basic content for the initial homepage is as follows: 

<body>
<h1>Deskcraft Toolworks, LLC</h1>
<h2>High-quality <strong>digital</strong> tooling, made <em>by</em> and <em>for</em> people doing <strong>real work</strong> in the <strong>analog</strong> world.</h2>
</body>
